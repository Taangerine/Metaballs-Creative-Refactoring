# Collision Based Metaball Speeds Within an Isosurface

This repository includes a creative refactoring of The Coding Train's (Dan Shiffman) Coding Challenge: Metaballs. My refactoring takes the Metaballs and increases their speeds when they hit the edges of the canvas. It also has a counter at the top for how many times the edges have been hit by the Metaballs.
